 This video implements an 'Algorithm Simulator'. 
 This project will be using Python GUI and created with python Tkinter and Pygame module. 

“Algorithm Simulator” as per the input choices of the user provides different visualizations for different types of algorithms and helps users to get the picture of their processing. It reduces difficulties in understanding of data structure and algorithms by giving step by step explanation through visual effects and animations.
